    This program generates a dynamic template file for the Redfish Interface
    Emulator from a mockup file.
    
    The resultant template file needs to be modified to indicated the
    wildcards.

Usage:
     python dynamic_codegen.py <class name> <template directory>

    The mockup file, index.json, is read to determine the contents of the

    There are two of ways to read the mockup file:
    - The index.json file can be read as file of text lines. Then
      'file.readlines" can read the file as a list of lines (brute
      force).  This preserves the order of the JSON objects
    - The index.json file can be read as a json file.  Then json.read can
      read the file into a dictionary.  However, this would scramble
      the order of json objects

    Next the in-memory data structure needs to be modified to insert the
